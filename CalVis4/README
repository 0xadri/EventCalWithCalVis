CalVis4 is a fork CalVis3. CalVis4 is different from CalVis3 as it displays 
the calendar along a list of the next 5 event in a left sliding-tab. Although
this is a different use of the javascript from CalVis3, it does work very
similarly and some improvement has been made on the code. See change list.

CalVis3 is a fork of an apparently dormant project initiated by Austin Chau 
who appears to be or have been a Google Employee. The project home page for 
the original project is: http://code.google.com/p/calvis/

The SVN repository (read-only) for the original project is available at
http://calvis.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
